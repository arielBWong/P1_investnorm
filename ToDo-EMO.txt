Fig. 5 - landscape doesn't look right .. ? + objective axis 
'save data from surrogate main de ?'

For infill search - use existing ND points also in the initial population of DE.
'done'

Infill search and extreme point search  - details of algorithm, and related parameters needed (what algorithm, what crossovers, etc., or a reference to a paper/python library of the implementation used)
'can be done at the stage of paper update writing'

HV convergence plot needed - relative to 1.1 times the normalized value w.r.t TRUE Pareto front. 
'every iteration, there needs a function takes pf and nd_front, and return two values of [hv_pf, hv_nd], save into hv_converg_seed.csv file'
'done'

For all problems - Need to see the initial state of the population in f-space apart from the final state. 
'for each problem, save a png and a eps of init population w.r.t.  pareto front'
'done'

Special figures - to explain the relevant factors that affected the performance 
(We may not need all plots above, but we should observe them to understand the performance). 

Statistical significance test needed for comparisons of final HV. 
'load all nd, normalize with pf and calculate hv, run statistical test?'

What happens when we have a case with normalization based on full population ? 
'exisiting'

Can we have one three objective example where initial population doesn't cover the range ? e.g. NOT dtlz2; perhaps one of the wfg. 

Dimension of the problems are not mentioned (D)
'can be done while update script'

Add DTLZ3 - reduce ruggedness like DTLZ1
